# Leetcode

Hey there! I’ve been trying to make coding more enjoyable and consistent, and I’ve come up with a great idea: documenting my daily coding adventures! I’ll be solving LeetCode Daily, and I’ll keep a record of it here. This way, I can stay on track with my coding goals and have a fun part of the day after I’ve finished coding.
